Living here allows you to experience the diversity and excitement of Toronto. You can live among locals while within close proximity to all the city has to offer. We love to stroll along Queen St and browse the independent galleries and shops or relax in one of the trendy cafes watching city life pass by. Steps away is Trinity-Bellwoods Park, one of the largest in the city, where we can get loss in nature or play a game of tennis, baseball or soccer. An extended walk from the house will take you through multicultural neighbourhoods of Little Italy, Chinatown and Kensington Market. Getting to the city centre along Queen St with its fashion stores or King St with its trendy restaurants and performance theatres provide some of the most interesting walks you will find in the city.    \r\n\r\nThese are some of the reasons we have made this part of Toronto our home.

I've had so many wonderful conversations and worldly insights from my guests, that it's added a whole new dimension to my Air B&B experience. It's certainly a unique opportunity and continues to be very rewarding for me. I hope it's the same for you! \n\nMy studio: The space is as seen in the photos. It's kept very clean and tidy. The private room is very comfortable and free of my personal belongings. I know that some of you may desire the residential comforts of sofas and dining tables in the lower area of the studio, so if this existing minimalism is not your style, not a problem at all. I can certainly understand that. This is a 'unique' space after all, and crafted around the lifestyle of a photographer :) \n\nBut if it IS your taste! and you are interested in staying here in the private room, please let me know! :) All the best on your travels.\n\n\"Always do right- this will gratify some and astonish the rest.\" Mark Twain","within an hour","100%",null,"f","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/ba261735-17e7-41c2-9a50-7512bc14486c.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/ba261735-17e7-41c2-9a50-7512bc14486c.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","Parkdale",0.0,0.0,"['email', 'phone', 'facebook', 'reviews', 'jumio', 'government_id']","t","t","Parkdale","South Parkdale",null,43.63895,-79.42246,"Loft","Entire home/apt",2,1.0,1.0,1.0,"{Wifi,\"Air conditioning\",Kitchen,Heating,Washer,Dryer,\"Smoke detector\",\"First aid kit\",Essentials,Shampoo}","$235.00",2,365,2,2,365,365,2.0,365.0,"5 weeks ago","t",0,13,15,15,"2020-01-07",54,4,"2011-10-12","2019-08-11",96.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,9.0,null,"f",1,1,0,0,0.54],[2020,192860,"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/192860",20200107050155,"2020-01-07","Modern, Clean & Quiet 2bd @ High Park","Modern and clean 2 bedroom in the Junction We have a large duplex  and it has 2 apartments.

I work in finance.  My husband (who comes from France) and I like to travel as often as we can.  My family recently expanded again as we welcomed our second baby daughter.  Our first is now a toddler!  We often travel to Europe where we have family.  We are active, enjoy many outdoor activities including camping, skiing, sailing.  My favourite foods are international:  Indian, Thai, Japanese, Filipino, Greek, Italian, French, with a soft spot for comfort foods!  Anything creative will catch my attention.  As I host, I am enthusiastic to show you all Toronto has to offer so you fall in love with our beautiful city, where I was born and raised.  Toronto has more and more to offer each year and is becoming a bustling cosmopolitain city.  I love that we have TIFF (I enjoyed going yearly before becoming a mom and having less time)!  Being a foodie, I also love that Toronto has some of the best restaurants and cuisine from all over the world.  Harbourfront, where our condo is located, is a great combo of a calm retreat and an active main attraction!  The neighbourhood of Harbourfront is very touristic and recently underwent a huge and expensive construction facelift from granite cobbled sidewalks to a new bike/pedestrian path in front of our building extending across the lake, from east to west, over 20 km.   Our  bungalow in thé Danforth Village is steps away from shops and the subway where downtown is accessible in 15 minutes but also a quiet neighbourhood retreat. Our newly renovated house is calm and relaxing. Our Beaches House offers some of the best family experiences in the city. Steps away from the Beach and Lake, enjoy the hustle of the Queen St shops and restaurants and take the streetcar to Leslieville, Riverdale and Downtown all within 30 min or less. I ask is that Guests respect our property (which we take great pride in) and leave it as you found it.  I will do the same for any property I stay in!  As a guest, my favourite thing about AirBnB is I get to pretend I am local when I stay in someone's home.  It gives me a totally different perspective of the place I am visiting, one I find fascinating as we become part of the community!

Called the Grand Dame of Niagara, this classic Victorian is one of the earliest and largest homes in the Trinity-Bellwoods area of Queen West long before it was developed into the Art and Entertainment centre of Toronto. This house has been meticulously restored in the last 10 years with the goal of keeping its old world charm while updating to provide all the comforts of a modern home. \r\n\r\nOur community is populated mostly by artists and families who have made the area home for generations. Living here allows you to experience the diversity and excitement of Toronto. You can live among locals while within close proximity to all the city has to offer. We love to stroll along Queen St and browse the independent galleries and shops or relax in one of the trendy cafes watching city life pass by. Steps away is Trinity-Bellwoods Park, one of the largest in the city, where we can get loss in nature or play a game of tennis, baseball or soccer. An extended walk from the house will take you through multicultural neighbourhoods of Little Italy, Chinatown and Kensington Market.

The house is located on Euclid Avenue - the downtown edge of the Trinity Bellwoods neighbourhood - a lushly treed area that is a brief walk from the centre of the city. No need to have a car here. The house is one of the older homes on the street - originally a store in the middle of a residential block. Built on the orchard lands of the old Gorevale estate, it is now situated right in the middle of the most popular and hip neighbourhoods of Toronto: West Queen Street West, Little Italy, Ossington, Kensington Market, Chinatown and Dundas to name a few.

To pin it down more distinctly, he describes it as me being very European. Luckily, he yearns to live in Europe. I am an autodidact, read a fair amount, and think copiously. My sense of humour seems to be in the ear of the beholder. Some people think that I am outrageously funny and start laughing before I even open my mouth. Others believe that I am the most serious person they meet.

This charming basement apartment is located on a cute street in the Dufferin and College area. Close to a great coffee shop, bars, food, galleries, and Dufferin Grove Park. The apartment features an open living room/kitchen layout with nice ambient and warm lighting features. The bedroom is small but cozy which lends a very restful sleep. 4 people can be accommodated by converting the futon couch into a bed. The bathroom is admittedly small but serves it's purpose for getting ready for your day in Toronto. There are two closets for storage and clothes. ","It's hard to summarize all the great things about our neighbourhood! We have a great Park, a great Mall (it may seem funny to be excited about a mall, but it is pretty great), an organic grocery store, a farmers market, and good access to transit. The area is culturally diverse which means we're minutes from a great Portuguese Churrascaria, Vietnamese Pho joint, Tortilleria, and just around the corner is Tavoos, a fantastic Persian restaurant that's been getting lots of attention for it's breakfasts and lunch. We are also right next to Little Italy so if you like Italian it's not too far away either!  We have the best coffee shop in the  city \"The Common\" just two quick blocks away.

Our property is a labour of love. We enjoy taking care of it and making it available to guests from around the world. We've had the pleasure of hosting guests from so many places, including Ireland, England, Scotland, Egypt, Germany, France, Spain, Denmark, Sweden, Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, Nova Scotia, Nunavut, Quebec, New York, Connecticut, Michigan, Texas, California, North Carolina, Ohio, Florida, Colorado, Kentucky, Hong Kong, Kenya, India, Mexico, Australia, Singapore Slovakia, Ukraine, Israel and The Bahamas. It's been a treat getting to know all of these wonderful people and helping them have a pleasant stay at the house. We love to do gardening....our profile photo was taken in our garden on a warm, bright summer night with a full moon.\r\n\r\nWe love the quiet, friendly neighbourhood (with many original owners). The privacy and peacefulness of the backyard with all the lush greenery is so relaxing. The layout of the house, with bright windows all around is also very appealing. While sitting on the deck, you feel like you're out in the country. If you enjoy cooking, there's a lovely herb garden in the backyard with a variety of fresh seasonings. \r\n\r\nThe location of this property is great because it's close to the main highway so you can get around quickly by car. You can also use public transit...the bus stop is right around the corner. Travel in any direction to get to shops, restaurants, movie theatres and other attractions. The Toronto Zoo is just a 10 minute drive from the house and all of the major attractions are located within 30 minutes from the house. There's plenty to see and do in downtown Toronto and all around the city.

It is bounded at the north by King Street West, the west by Dufferin Street, the south by the Gardiner Expressway, the east by Strachan Avenue, and the northeast by the CP railway tracks. The Liberty Village name was introduced as a positive 'brand' by the property owners and developers in the area in conjunction with the City of Toronto. The neighborhood aims to distinguish itself from Parkdale, which now begins west of Dufferin Street. Its location is considered one of its finest assets being a 15-minute walk to the Lakeshore, 20-minute streetcar ride to the financial core and a 20-minute walk from the entertainment/fashion/gallery districts of King St. West. Partly because of this, Liberty Village has experienced phenomenal growth from 2004 to the present in terms of new condos/lofts, office space, a new park, and a multitude of new shops and restaurants.

There are terrific parks nearby and it's easy to get downtown. Also, it's 2018, and this is Toronto.  I hope it goes without saying that absolutely everyone is welcome. Thanks for checking out our listing!  Please read everything. Yep - we unwittingly moved to one of the most up-and-coming, hip parts of Toronto and we are here to tell the world we love it.  There are cool little restaurants, bars, a brewery, coffee shops and GREAT parks to hang out in, or you can zoom downtown in about 20 min. on transit or a 5 min. taxi, Uber or Lyft and be in the heart of trendy shops, restaurants and all that is Toronto. Easy access to downtown, but located on a nice residential street, our little pad is a spotless, full one-bedroom basement apartment that can accommodate 2 people.  We love the AirBnB culture, and have benefited from it ourselves, so we like to keep the rates reasonable, too. ","The neighbourhood is one of Toronto's newly popular areas.  Technically speaking, it's called Davenport.  Most of the cool stuff is between us on the north end and Bloorcourt on the south.  Starting off with Davenport Ave., our neighbour Gian owns the Sovereign Espresso Bar and it is awesome.  They started serving brunch recently and it's quickly become the neighbourhood favourite.  Heading south, Geary Ave. hosts more espresso - The Dark Horse. Greater Good - a gorgeous pub with rotating local taps and North of Brooklyn pizza in-house, a beekeeping supply store and a Portugese bakery with fresh bread and those crazy good egg tarts!  Further south on Bloor St. is where the action is - new restaurants are opening daily, it seems.  Burdock has their own in house micro-brewery and bottle shop that's open 'til 11pm (even on Sunday), The Three Speed has delicious affordable food and Bar Neon gets crazy busy on a Saturday night.

I've had so many wonderful conversations and worldly insights from my guests, that it's added a whole new dimension to my Air B&B experience. It's certainly a unique opportunity and continues to be very rewarding for me. I hope it's the same for you! \n\nMy studio: The space is as seen in the photos. It's kept very clean and tidy. The private room is very comfortable and free of my personal belongings. I know that some of you may desire the residential comforts of sofas and dining tables in the lower area of the studio, so if this existing minimalism is not your style, not a problem at all. I can certainly understand that. This is a 'unique' space after all, and crafted around the lifestyle of a photographer :) \n\nBut if it IS your taste! and you are interested in staying here in the private room, please let me know! :) All the best on your travels.\n\n\"Always do right- this will gratify some and astonish the rest.\" Mark Twain</td><td>within an hour</td><td>100%</td><td>null</td><td>f</td><td>https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/ba261735-17e7-41c2-9a50-7512bc14486c.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small</td><td>https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/ba261735-17e7-41c2-9a50-7512bc14486c.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium</td><td>Parkdale</td><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>['email', 'phone', 'facebook', 'reviews', 'jumio', 'government_id']</td><td>t</td><td>t</td><td>Parkdale</td><td>South Parkdale</td><td>null</td><td>43.63895</td><td>-79.42246</td><td>Loft</td><td>Entire home/apt</td><td>2</td><td>1.0</td><td>1.0</td><td>1.0</td><td>{Wifi,\"Air conditioning\",Kitchen,Heating,Washer,Dryer,\"Smoke detector\",\"First aid kit\",Essentials,Shampoo}</td><td>$235.00</td><td>2</td><td>365</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>365</td><td>365</td><td>2.0</td><td>365.0</td><td>5 weeks ago</td><td>t</td><td>0</td><td>13</td><td>15</td><td>15</td><td>2020-01-07</td><td>54</td><td>4</td><td>2011-10-12</td><td>2019-08-11</td><td>96.0</td><td>10.0</td><td>10.0</td><td>10.0</td><td>10.0</td><td>10.0</td><td>9.0</td><td>null</td><td>f</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0.54</td></tr><tr><td>2020</td><td>192860</td><td>https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/192860</td><td>20200107050155</td><td>2020-01-07</td><td>Modern, Clean & Quiet 2bd @ High Park</td><td>Modern and clean 2 bedroom in the Junction We have a large duplex  and it has 2 apartments.

I have been welcoming guests at our B&B for years and doing so, I have a great knowledge of Toronto, my pleasure is to help all my guests with Itinerary plans to save time and money while here on vacation.  As Travellers ourselves, we love to meet and greet with people from all over the world, making you feel at home, while having the comforts of a Hotel.\r\n\r\nI hate working out, however, I am addicted to exercise, I am a Personal Trainer, teaching daily, no matter if it's my job or if I'm on vacation.  I like bike riding or jogging, when the sun is shining, love Spring/Summer weather, not winter, I try to get away to somewhere hot, most of January/February.  Our favorite place right now is Puerto Escondido, (Mexico), a Surfing destination, but I don't surf, just love watching and challenging the waves.  No matter, we love to travel!!  But still have a long list of places to go too on our Bucket list.  \r\n\r\nI love socializing, being surrounded with good company, conversation and a bottle of red wine, or two.\r\n\r\nI have become picky with food, love my veggies, don't eat meat, still like fish, mostly salmon, but I'm alone with this, I still cook all kinds of meats for my family and friends.  Apparently, I make the best ribs.  All the books I read are health and/or Nutritional books.\r\n\r\nI want to learn Spanish and can't live without love, especially from my kids.\r\n\r\nWhen guests book with me, it is my pleasure to give advise to save money while touring our Big City, Toronto.  \r\n\r\nPlease note:  We have two new large rooms, not yet on our Website, each has a Private Bathroom, with a small fridge/microwave/toaster/coffee and kettle.

The TTC (Toronto Transit Commission, otherwise public transit) can take you to the subway in 5 minutes or you can stay on the streetcar for 30 minutes and end up in downtown Toronto!  Neighbouring the Beaches, approx 3 km to the west of us is trendy Leslieville, with lots to shop and eat too!</td><td>https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/87955546/3684c4c1_original.jpg?aki_policy=large</td><td>1816495</td><td>https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/1816495</td><td>Katharine</td><td>2012-02-27</td><td>Toronto, Ontario, Canada</td><td>I am a married female living and working in Toronto, ON, Canada.  I work in finance.  My husband (who comes from France) and I like to travel as often as we can.  My family recently expanded again as we welcomed our second baby daughter.  Our first is now a toddler!  We often travel to Europe where we have family.  We are active, enjoy many outdoor activities including camping, skiing, sailing.  My favourite foods are international:  Indian, Thai, Japanese, Filipino, Greek, Italian, French, with a soft spot for comfort foods!  Anything creative will catch my attention.  As I host, I am enthusiastic to show you all Toronto has to offer so you fall in love with our beautiful city, where I was born and raised.  Toronto has more and more to offer each year and is becoming a bustling cosmopolitain city.  I love that we have TIFF (I enjoyed going yearly before becoming a mom and having less time)!  Being a foodie, I also love that Toronto has some of the best restaurants and cuisine from all over the world.  Harbourfront, where our condo is located, is a great combo of a calm retreat and an active main attraction!  The neighbourhood of Harbourfront is very touristic and recently underwent a huge and expensive construction facelift from granite cobbled sidewalks to a new bike/pedestrian path in front of our building extending across the lake, from east to west, over 20 km.   Our  bungalow in thé Danforth Village is steps away from shops and the subway where downtown is accessible in 15 minutes but also a quiet neighbourhood retreat. Our newly renovated house is calm and relaxing. Our Beaches House offers some of the best family experiences in the city. Steps away from the Beach and Lake, enjoy the hustle of the Queen St shops and restaurants and take the streetcar to Leslieville, Riverdale and Downtown all within 30 min or less. I ask is that Guests respect our property (which we take great pride in) and leave it as you found it.  I will do the same for any property I stay in!  As a guest, my favourite thing about AirBnB is I get to pretend I am local when I stay in someone's home.  It gives me a totally different perspective of the place I am visiting, one I find fascinating as we become part of the community!

Called the Grand Dame of Niagara, this classic Victorian is one of the earliest and largest homes in the Trinity-Bellwoods area of Queen West long before it was developed into the Art and Entertainment centre of Toronto. This house has been meticulously restored in the last 10 years with the goal of keeping its old world charm while updating to provide all the comforts of a modern home. \r\n\r\nOur community is populated mostly by artists and families who have made the area home for generations. Living here allows you to experience the diversity and excitement of Toronto. You can live among locals while within close proximity to all the city has to offer. We love to stroll along Queen St and browse the independent galleries and shops or relax in one of the trendy cafes watching city life pass by. Steps away is Trinity-Bellwoods Park, one of the largest in the city, where we can get loss in nature or play a game of tennis, baseball or soccer. An extended walk from the house will take you through multicultural neighbourhoods of Little Italy, Chinatown and Kensington Market. Getting to the city centre along Queen St with its fashion stores or King St with its trendy restaurants and performance theatres provide some of the most interesting walks you will find in the city.    \r\n\r\nThese are some of the reasons we have made this part of Toronto our home. We are avid travellers ourselves and appreciate the whole world of experiences outside our doors. It would be our pleasure to share these experiences with our guests from all over the world.  </td><td>within a few hours</td><td>100%</td><td>null</td><td>t</td><td>https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/304551/profile_pic/1319378136/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small</td><td>https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/304551/profile_pic/1319378136/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium</td><td>Niagara</td><td>6.0</td><td>6.0</td><td>['email', 'phone', 'reviews']</td><td>t</td><td>f</td><td>Palmerston/Little Italy</td><td>Palmerston-Little Italy</td><td>null</td><td>43.66137</td><td>-79.41074</td><td>Apartment</td><td>Entire home/apt</td><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>1.0</td><td>1.0</td><td>{\"Cable TV\",Wifi,\"Air conditioning\",Heating,\"Smoke detector\",\"Carbon monoxide detector\",\"Fire extinguisher\",Essentials,Hangers,\"Hair dryer\",Iron,\"translation missing: en.hosting_amenity_49\",\"translation missing: en.hosting_amenity_50\",\"Bed linens\"}</td><td>$80.00</td><td>60</td><td>1125</td><td>60</td><td>60</td><td>1125</td><td>1125</td><td>60.0</td><td>1125.0</td><td>6 months ago</td><td>t</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>251</td><td>2020-01-07</td><td>2</td><td>0</td><td>2014-10-27</td><td>2016-07-01</td><td>80.0</td><td>10.0</td><td>8.0</td><td>10.0</td><td>10.0</td><td>10.0</td><td>8.0</td><td>null</td><td>f</td><td>5</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>0</td><td>0.03</td></tr><tr><td>2020</td><td>396504</td><td>https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/396504</td><td>20200107050155</td><td>2020-01-07</td><td>Modern 3 bed home w/garden in funky Queen W</td><td>A whole house in one of the coolest neighbourhoods in the world!

My sense of humour seems to be in the ear of the beholder. Some people think that I am outrageously funny and start laughing before I even open my mouth. Others believe that I am the most serious person they meet.

I think the key to our location and the space we are offering is that we can give an inside track to the best that Toronto has to offer in terms of art, culture, and food. We both work in the arts.  This charming basement apartment is located on a cute street in the Dufferin and College area. Close to a great coffee shop, bars, food, galleries, and Dufferin Grove Park. The apartment features an open living room/kitchen layout with nice ambient and warm lighting features. The bedroom is small but cozy which lends a very restful sleep. 4 people can be accommodated by converting the futon couch into a bed. The bathroom is admittedly small but serves it's purpose for getting ready for your day in Toronto. There are two closets for storage and clothes. </td><td>It's hard to summarize all the great things about our neighbourhood! We have a great Park, a great Mall (it may seem funny to be excited about a mall, but it is pretty great), an organic grocery store, a farmers market, and good access to transit. The area is culturally diverse which means we're minutes from a great Portuguese Churrascaria, Vietnamese Pho joint, Tortilleria, and just around the corner is Tavoos, a fantastic Persian restaurant that's been getting lots of attention for it's breakfasts and lunch.

To pin it down more distinctly, he describes it as me being very European. Luckily, he yearns to live in Europe. I am an autodidact, read a fair amount, and think copiously. My sense of humour seems to be in the ear of the beholder. Some people think that I am outrageously funny and start laughing before I even open my mouth. Others believe that I am the most serious person they meet. Frequently this split of opinion can happen within the same room. \r\n\r\nOf course, we are kind... and helpful... and sincere... and everything else a heart and someone looking for a place to stay could desire.

And eat.</td><td>within a few hours</td><td>100%</td><td>null</td><td>f</td><td>https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/4357559/profile_pic/1378218323/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small</td><td>https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/4357559/profile_pic/1378218323/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium</td><td>Palmerston/Little Italy</td><td>1.0</td><td>1.0</td><td>['email', 'phone', 'facebook', 'reviews', 'jumio', 'government_id']</td><td>t</td><td>f</td><td>Palmerston/Little Italy</td><td>Palmerston-Little Italy</td><td>null</td><td>43.654740000000004</td><td>-79.42532</td><td>Apartment</td><td>Entire home/apt</td><td>2</td><td>1.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>1.0</td><td>{Internet,Wifi,\"Air conditioning\",Kitchen,Heating,Washer,Dryer,\"Smoke detector\",\"Carbon monoxide detector\",\"Safety card\",\"Fire extinguisher\",Essentials,Shampoo,\"24-hour check-in\",Hangers,\"Hair dryer\",Iron,\"Laptop friendly workspace\",\"translation missing: en.hosting_amenity_49\",\"translation missing: en.hosting_amenity_50\",\"Private entrance\",\"Hot water\",\"Bed linens\",\"Extra pillows and blankets\",Microwave,Refrigerator,\"Dishes and silverware\",\"Cooking basics\",Oven,Stove,\"Luggage dropoff allowed\"}</td><td>$90.00</td><td>3</td><td>26</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>26</td><td>26</td><td>3.0</td><td>26.0</td><td>2 days ago</td><td>t</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>2020-01-07</td><td>162</td><td>6</td><td>2012-12-23</td><td>2019-10-09</td><td>92.0</td><td>10.0</td><td>9.0</td><td>10.0</td><td>9.0</td><td>10.0</td><td>9.0</td><td>null</td><td>f</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1.89</td></tr><tr><td>2020</td><td>833588</td><td>https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/833588</td><td>20200107050155</td><td>2020-01-07</td><td>Lovely place in prime Yorkville</td><td>Yorkville prime location, among luxury hotels.

One parking spot included.  Located on the fourth floor and just minutes away from the art, fashion and entertainment districts of Toronto.  Steps from trendy restaurants, bars and stores.  This location has it all at your fingertips, just a few blocks away from Queen West's iconic Gladstone and Drake hotels, the lake sh</td><td>ABOUT THE NEIGHBORHOOD/LOCATION: Liberty Village is a neighborhood enclave in the Toronto South Parkdale neighborhood. It is bounded at the north by King Street West, the west by Dufferin Street, the south by the Gardiner Expressway, the east by Strachan Avenue, and the northeast by the CP railway tracks. The Liberty Village name was introduced as a positive 'brand' by the property owners and developers in the area in conjunction with the City of Toronto. The neighborhood aims to distinguish itself from Parkdale, which now begins west of Dufferin Street. Its location is considered one of its finest assets being a 15-minute walk to the Lakeshore, 20-minute streetcar ride to the financial core and a 20-minute walk from the entertainment/fashion/gallery districts of King St. West. Partly because of this, Liberty Village has experienced phenomenal growth from 2004 to the present in terms of new condos/lofts, office space, a new park, and a multitude of new shops and restaurants. </td><td>https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/33896511/10a7a572_original.jpg?aki_policy=large</td><td>4599751</td><td>https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/4599751</td><td>Mia</td><td>2013-01-05</td><td>Toronto, Ontario, Canada</td><td>Hello there, my name is Mia and I want to be your host!  \r\n\r\nThis is my first furnished property which is located at my house but with its own entry.

We love to stay in more personal places when we travel rather than the conventional big hotels that feel the same everywhere.  It's great to have the option of cooking a meal or making a cup of coffee without having to go out and it's also nice to see the areas where real people live in the city.\r\n\r\nMost of my life revolves around my art.  I teach printmaking and an unusual course focused on using art for personal development.  I also love to paint faces!  \r\n\r\nFor us, the best time is the summer when we can eat most of our meals out on our very private back deck and spend time relaxing and reading while the birds and squirrels play.

Travel. I'm always on the move - exploring, learning, and growing. \r\n2. Music. I'm a classically trained violinist, and I've performed all over the world. I also play piano. And, I also compose. I'm always down for a jam session. \r\n3. Sports like cross-country running, swimming, and sailing. \r\n4. Friends. Where would I be with out them? \r\n5. Teaching. Gifts are meant to share. In my case, it's my musical talent, so I try to spread my love for music via teaching to as many people as I can. \r\n\r\nWhat is like to be my guest?\r\nWell, most likely, I won't be there. As I said, I'm always on the move - hopping from Toronto, to New York City, to China, down to Florida. That being said, I'm still very accessible.

We always enjoy meeting new people.\r\n</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>f</td><td>https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/265033/profile_pic/1346856571/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small</td><td>https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/265033/profile_pic/1346856571/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium</td><td>Dufferin Grove</td><td>1.0</td><td>1.0</td><td>['email', 'phone', 'reviews', 'jumio', 'government_id', 'work_email']</td><td>t</td><td>t</td><td>Dufferin Grove</td><td>Dufferin Grove</td><td>null</td><td>43.65803</td><td>-79.43175</td><td>House</td><td>Entire home/apt</td><td>4</td><td>2.0</td><td>2.0</td><td>2.0</td><td>{TV,\"Cable TV\",Internet,Wifi,\"Air conditioning\",Kitchen,Heating,Washer,Dryer,\"Smoke detector\",\"Carbon monoxide detector\",\"Fire extinguisher\",\"translation missing: en.hosting_amenity_49\",\"translation missing: en.hosting_amenity_50\"}</td><td>$135.00</td><td>5</td><td>30</td><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>30</td><td>30</td><td>5.0</td><td>30.0</td><td>8 months ago</td><td>t</td><td>23</td><td>53</td><td>83</td><td>358</td><td>2020-01-07</td><td>6</td><td>0</td><td>2014-07-01</td><td>2016-10-28</td><td>97.0</td><td>10.0</td><td>10.0</td><td>10.0</td><td>10.0</td><td>10.0</td><td>10.0</td><td>null</td><td>f</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0.09</td></tr><tr><td>2020</td><td>1058442</td><td>https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/1058442</td><td>20200107050155</td><td>2020-01-07</td><td>2 Bedroom Penthouse Downtown</td><td>Yonge Suites has quickly become recognized as the furnished luxury suite of choice in downtown Toronto’s Financial District.

Thanks for checking out our listing!  Please read everything. Yep - we unwittingly moved to one of the most up-and-coming, hip parts of Toronto and we are here to tell the world we love it.

Technically speaking, it's called Davenport.  Most of the cool stuff is between us on the north end and Bloorcourt on the south.  Starting off with Davenport Ave., our neighbour Gian owns the Sovereign Espresso Bar and it is awesome.  They started serving brunch recently and it's quickly become the neighbourhood favourite.  Heading south, Geary Ave. hosts more espresso - The Dark Horse. Greater Good - a gorgeous pub with rotating local taps and North of Brooklyn pizza in-house, a beekeeping supply store and a Portugese bakery with fresh bread and those crazy good egg tarts!  Further south on Bloor St. is where the action is - new restaurants are opening daily, it seems.  Burdock has their own in house micro-brewery and bottle shop that's open 'til 11pm (even on Sunday), The Three Speed has delicious affordable food and Bar Neon gets crazy busy on a Saturday night.
