- 3. Conduct a thorough data analysis using a toolset you haven't worked with before.

## Project Outline for Data Analysis

- 1. Objectives: What are the goals of the analysis and why did you choose them? What question(s) do you want to answer? What hypothesis(es) do you have and what is your approach to tackle the problem?
- 2. Data Preparation: What was your data source (e.g., web scraping, corporate data, a standard machine learning data set, open data, etc.)? How good was the data quality? What did you need to do to procure it? What tools or code did you need to use to prepare it for analysis? What challenges did you face?
- 3. Analysis: What trends, correlations, and/or patterns do you see in the data?
- 4. Conclusions: What did you learn about your data set?
