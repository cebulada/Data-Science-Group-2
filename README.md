- [Apparently AirBnB is making a come back](https://www.forbes.com/sites/deniselyohn/2020/11/10/how-airbnb-survived-the-pandemic--and-how-you-can-too/?sh=87544a293845) and our group would like to see if this is true in the city of Toronto through their listings

## Type of Analysis

- We will leverage Databricks Community Edition and load in the data as .csv files
    - [link](https://community.cloud.databricks.com)
- We will leverage Koalas, a Pandas API for PySpark for DataFrame manipulations instead of PySpark
    - [link](https://koalas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
- We will leverage MLlib for machine learning
    - [link](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/reference/pyspark.ml.html)
- We will connect Azure Databricks instance to Power BI Desktop to generate visuals for data analysis

## Project Objectives

- 1. Research and report on a current evolving area of Big Data technology.
- 2. Conduct a thorough data analysis using a toolset you haven't worked with before.

## Project Outline for Data Analysis

- 1. Objectives: What are the goals of the analysis and why did you choose them? What question(s) do you want to answer? What hypothesis(es) do you have and what is your approach to tackle the problem?
- 2. Data Preparation: What was your data source (e.g., web scraping, corporate data, a standard machine learning data set, open data, etc.)? How good was the data quality? What did you need to do to procure it? What tools or code did you need to use to prepare it for analysis? What challenges did you face?
- 3. Analysis: What trends, correlations, and/or patterns do you see in the data?
- 4. Conclusions: What did you learn about your data set?
