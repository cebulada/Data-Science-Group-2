"neighborhood_overview"," The Darling Mansion is on residential Dovercourt Road, in downtown Toronto’s west end, between bustling Queen & Dundas Streets. West Queen West was recently recognized by Vogue Magazine as one of the trendiest neighbourhoods in the world for street fashion, second only to Tokyo’s Shimokitazawa. Dundas West is a pocket of city life tucked away from the city’s tourist destinations. This traditionally-Portuguese neighbourhood is now peppered with the neighbourhood cafes & bars of Toronto’s art, music, fashion & culinary communities. A short streetcar ride east takes you to Kensington Market, Toronto’s vintage clothes and farm-fresh food district with a bohemian flair. Seconds beyond Kensington is the most iconic of Toronto’s three Chinatowns, with seemingly-infinite options for late-night dining through 5am. Just southwest of the Darling Mansion is Parkdale: an up-and-coming, artistic neighbourhood that is home to the most sought after restaurants and live music community.
